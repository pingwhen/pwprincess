							<h2>Our <strong>Backstory</strong></h2>
							<p lead>As most founder stories go, we met on a yacht in Croatia for technology 'hackathon', where we were paired to develop a mobile app. We bonded over a shared vision of using technology for social impact to empower people.</p>

							<p lead>We fundamentally believe that safety should be a basic human right. ping<span class="alternative-font">WHEN</span> stems from our own personal experiences, coupled with the mission to put a positive dent in the challenge of global safety. Julie backpacked in a solo ‘around-the-world’ trip in 2012 and had a few moments where she was extremely fearful for her safety. She wondered if anyone would know if she didn’t arrive to an intended destination and how long it would take for someone to notice. Her mother appreciated quick daily notifications when she arrived safely. Julie couldn’t find anything in the market that she would use for personal safety and set out on a mission to create the change she wanted to see in the world. Sam reasonated with the mission of ping<span class="alternative-font">WHEN</span> as he is an avid runner and adventurer and appreciates a ‘safety net’ for his journeys alone.</p>

							<p lead>We are deeply saddened by the chilling headline stories such as the 2014 kidnapping of +200 Nigerian girls, the 2012 gang rape incident of an Indian student, and the haunting statistic that 1 and 5 women on college campuses has been sexually assaulted during their tenure. These unfortunate stories, and the hundreds of thousands that do not reach mainstream media, underscore the importance of accessible and effective security technologies. We are on a hell-bent mission to create a tool to empower people to move safely.</p>
