    <strong>Sharing of Your Information</strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Personal Information: </strong>
    We will not rent or sell your personal information to third parties outside the Company and its controlled subsidiaries and affiliates without your
    consent, except as noted below:
</p>
<p>
    We share your information, including name, email and location, with others within your PingWHEN designated contacts that you predefined.
</p>
<p>
    We may share your personal information with our third-party business partners, vendors and consultants who perform services on our behalf, such as
    accounting, managerial, technical, marketing or analytic services. These business partners will be given access to your information as necessary to deliver
    the Service under reasonable confidentiality terms.
</p>
<p>
    Any information or content that you voluntarily post to the website or to our Facebook page will automatically be available to the public. We may publicly
    post your reviews and comments online on our website or mobile app, or link your reviews to third party websites.
</p>
<p>
    We may aggregate or otherwise strip data of all personally identifying characteristics of our data and may share that aggregated, anonymized data with
    third parties.
</p>
<p>
    We may at any time buy or sell/divest the company, or any combination of its products, services, assets and/or businesses. Personal information such as
    customer names and email addresses, and other user information related to the Service will likely be one of the items transferred in these types of
    transactions. We may also transfer or assign such information in the course of corporate divestitures, mergers, acquisitions, bankruptcies, dissolutions or
    similar transactions or proceedings.
</p>
<p>
    Except as described above, we will not disclose personal information to third parties (including law enforcement, other government entity, or civil
    litigant; excluding our subcontractors) unless required to do so by law or subpoena or if in our sole discretion, we determine it is necessary to (a)
    conform to the law, comply with legal process, or investigate, prevent, or take action regarding suspected or actual illegal activities; (b) to enforce our
    Terms of Use, take precautions against liability, to investigate and defend ourselves against any claims or allegations, or to protect the security or
    integrity of our site; and/or (c) to exercise or protect the rights, property, or personal safety of Pingwhen, our Users or others.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>3. How We Protect Your Information</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Pingwhen cares about the security of your information and uses commercially reasonable physical, administrative, and technological safeguards to preserve
    the integrity and security of all information we collect and that we share with our service providers. However, no security system is impenetrable and we
    cannot guarantee the security of our systems 100%. In the event that any information under our control is compromised as a result of a breach of security,
    we will take reasonable steps to investigate the situation and where appropriate, notify those individuals whose information may have been compromised and
    take other steps, in accordance with any applicable laws and regulations.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>4. Your Choices About Your Information</strong>
</p>
<p>
    You may, of course, decline to submit any personal information through the Service, in which case Pingwhen may not be able to provide its Services to you.
